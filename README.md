## Portfolio Balancer
Portfolio Balancer is a simple tool designed to help investors maintain a balanced stock portfolio. It currently focuses on the 10 stocks from the Institut des Libertés, as proposed by Charles Gave. The goal of this tool is to provide monthly or quarterly rebalancing recommendations based on your portfolio.

## Objective
The main objective of this tool is to tell you what to buy and what to sell to keep your stock portfolio balanced. The tool calculates the current value of each stock and compares it to the ideal weight in your portfolio, helping you avoid overexposure to any single asset.

# Current Features
A fixed list of 10 stocks from the Institut des Libertés portfolio.
Simple rebalancing recommendations: the tool will tell you which stocks to buy and sell to maintain a balanced portfolio.
# Future Plans
Adding the ability to change stocks in the portfolio.
Implementing buy/sell alerts if a stock moves too far from its ideal allocation.
More advanced features like tracking additional asset classes (bonds, gold, etc.) and integrating real-time alerts.
# How It Works
The tool retrieves the latest stock prices and calculates the current value of each stock in your portfolio.
It compares the current distribution of your portfolio to the ideal distribution.
It then suggests buying or selling actions to maintain the balance.
# Conclusion
This project is just the beginning. The ultimate goal is to create a comprehensive and dynamic tool that helps investors manage their portfolios more effectively, making it easier to maintain diversification and avoid overexposure to any individual stock.
